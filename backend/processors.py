"""Which processor runs the ONNX models: the CPU, or a GPU the bundled runtime can drive.

The Windows installer bundles ONNX Runtime's DirectML build, which offers a
`DmlExecutionProvider` device for each hardware DirectX 12 GPU (NVIDIA, AMD or
Intel) through the ordinary display driver. macOS and the CPU wheel offer only the
CPU. A per-application GPU preference in Windows or a vendor control panel cannot
move this work: it picks the GPU that draws a program's graphics, while inference
runs in the backend process on the provider its session was created with.

A GPU is identified by its PCI identity, `gpu:<vendor>:<device>` in lowercase hex,
with `:<n>` for the nth identical card. DirectML addresses a GPU by its Windows
adapter index, which follows display wiring and the graphics preference, so the
index is never saved. ONNX Runtime reads its device list once per process, while
DirectML looks the index up again whenever it creates a session, so each request
matches the identity against Windows' current adapter list (`_dxgi_adapters`).
